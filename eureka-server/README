Service Discorvery

- The service discovery pattern has the following problem, solution, and solution requirements

Problem ?

- How can clients find microservices and their instances?
- Microservices instances are typically assigned dynamically allocated IP addresses when they start up, for example, when running in containers. This makes it difficult for a client to make a request to a microservice tha

Solution

- Add a new component – a service discovery service – to the system landscape, which keeps track of currently available microservices and the IP addresses of its instances
- Automatically register/unregister microservices and their instances as they come and go
- The client must be able to make a request to a logical endpoint for the microservice. The request will be routed to one of the available microservice instances
- Requests to a microservice must be load-balanced over the available instances
- We must be able to detect instances that currently are unhealthy, so that requests will not be routed to them
